Responsive design

Responsive design means that the HTML page 
    is responsive to the change of the width


1) Use relative units instead of fixed units

    Fixed units: px  [It does not change]
    Relative units: vw, vh, %, rem(16px in big screens, smaller in smaller screens)         [It changes depending on the screen size]

2) Flex Direction

    For big screens: flex-drection: row;
    For small screens: flex-drection: column;
